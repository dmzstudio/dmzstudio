# Hello! I'm David

I'm a recent Computer Science grad with a passion for web development, fluid responsive design, and writing minimalist, reusable, and scalable code.

Exploring **AI**, **machine learning**, and **big data**

Am interested in projects at the intersection of **language**, **linguistics**, and **audio engineering**.
